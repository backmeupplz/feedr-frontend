By the way, the team didn't buy a subscription to the service, but I got access to the bot's messages, and I was very happy about it. You don't have to pay for the whole company or give them access to your account - you can just invite them to the admins.\n          \n          Now we will respond as a team to subscribers from one person, from the site or in the Telegram bot.
